# Snake
The classic snake game implemented in python with pygame

I made a snake game in python using pygame.
This code is for personnal learning, comments are appreciated.
This will remain untexturred because i'm not planning on learning pixel art or modelisation for the moment.

You can use and modify this code as you want

# About the game 

You are controlling the brown circle, representing the head of your snake on a 10 x 10 checkerboard. 
The snake is going forward and you just have to control his direction using the directionnal arrows.

The red circles are apples that you can eat.

When you eat an apple your body grow ( blue circle ).

If you are going off the grid or touching your own body you lose.

Score is determined by the length of your body.
Your goal is to reach a score of 99.
